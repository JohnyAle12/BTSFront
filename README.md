## About Project

This is a web application where i put some knowledges about React and Typescript framework, here i build a basic application where we can log in users, save data history about weather cities and looking at this information. For this project i'm using hooks, custom hooks, app context, async functions and promises, clean code among others.

## Start Project

Before you download project, please run:

```bash
# install vendor packages
$ npm install
```

Make sure to check the .env.example and put the environment variables to connect with third-party providers

After you can execute the application in local environment with:

```bash
# start local project 
$ npm run dev
```

After you need to copy to .env.example file to .env.development and assign the necesary variables for third providers
For the local backend host usually you can use http://localhost:8000/api/

I know that is a bad practice but i will put here my secret keys to test application quickly
